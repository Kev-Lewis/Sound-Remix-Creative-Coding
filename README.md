Description:

There are two major changes that I wanted to make for this project. 

The first was making the lines more customizable by making the user able to adjust the sizes of
the lines for the music. I was able to do this by going around and adjusting values
until the things I wanted to change were changed, then swapping those values to variables and
made them adjustable by the arrow keys.

The second change I wanted to make was the amount of particles that
spawned to change based on the size of the center circle. I passed the size of the circle,
which was calculated by the amplitude of the song, and then passed it to the add particles
where it spawned a variable amount based on that size. I also made it so it randomly flashes
different colors to make it look a little more lively as well.
